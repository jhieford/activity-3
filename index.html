    <p>
        I choose BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) because I want to become a game developer. 
        I have always been interested in playing games and learning how they are made. 
        I believe BSIT can give me the skills I need to create games that people will enjoy.
        <br>
        I also want to work with other people who share the same passion for technology. 
        I know it will be challenging, but I am ready to work hard for my dream career. 
        I also want to meet classmates who have the same passion. 
        I hope to create games that inspire and entertain people.

        <br>
        I.T. fits me because it challenges me and helps me stay sharp, while also offering exciting career paths.
